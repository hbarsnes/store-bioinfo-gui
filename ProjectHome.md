# `StoreBioinfoGUI` #

**StoreBioinfoGUI** is a simple Java front end to <a href='http://www.bioinfo.no/storebioinfo'>StoreBioinfo</a> making it straightforward to organize the data in the format required by <b>StoreBioinfo</b>.

It also makes sure that the data has the meta data needed for future re-use of the data.

**StoreBioinfoGUI** only contains three settings and these are found in the config folder:
  * local\_path: the local path where the projects and datasets are to be stored
  * dataset\_types: the supported dataset types
  * quota\_ids: the quota ids - name and id
To edit the settings, simply open the files in a text browser and edit the fields.
