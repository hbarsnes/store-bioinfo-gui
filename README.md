# StoreBioinfoGUI

StoreBioinfoGUI is a simple Java front end to [StoreBioinfo](http://www.bioinfo.no/storebioinfo) making it straightforward to organize the data in the format required by StoreBioinfo. 

It also makes sure that the data has the meta data needed for future re-use of the data. 

StoreBioinfoGUI only contains three settings and these are found in the config folder: 
 - local_path: the local path where the projects and datasets are to be stored 
 - dataset_types: the supported dataset types 
 - quota_ids: the quota ids - name and id 
 
To edit the settings, simply open the files in a text browser and edit the fields.
